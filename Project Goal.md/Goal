Diabetes is a very common disease with a wide range of ages.  But the treatment varies from patient to patient.  Medication regimens and efficiency cycles are also very different for each patient.  We used patient information from 130 U.S. hospitals from 1999 to 2008. Through the data, we will analyze the response, cycle and drug resistance rate of different patients to treatment drugs.  However, through a large amount of data analysis can provide limited information.  Therefore, our project will use machine learning techniques to analyze patients' responses to drugs based on different attributes and determine what are the features that are affecting the readmittance rate.
