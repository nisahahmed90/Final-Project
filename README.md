# Final-Project

Goal:

Diabetes influences 37.3 million Americans. That's 1 in 10 people. Even worse, 1 in 3 adults in America, or 96 million adults have prediabetes. It's the seventh leading cause of death in the US .

Scientifically, diabetes is a serious chronic disease where people lose the ability to regulate the glucose levels in their blood. During digestion, food breaks down into sugar in the bloodstream. In a healthy body, this causes the pancreas to release insulin, a hormone that allows sugar to be used for energy. Diabetes is characterized as a problem with this feedback cycle (people are either unable to use the insulin or produce enough insulin). Diabetes has no cure, but early diagnoses and lifestyle changes (ie: losing weight, eating healthier, and being active) can be quite helpful.

Thus, it is obvious evident that diabetes is a disease that affects a lot of people . I truly believe that technology should be used to help people live better quality lives, and I think a statistical deep dive into understanding the inner workings of diabetes can help medical professionals find connections and improve treatements.

begining with the ETL process extracting diabeties dataset and cleaning the data 
removing all the dublicate values,
naming all the features,
['encounter_id', 'patient_nbr', 'race', 'gender', 'age', 'weight', 'admission_type_id', 'discharge_disposition_id', 'admission_source_id', 'time_in_hospital', 'payer_code', 'medical_specialty', 'num_lab_procedures', 'num_procedures', 'num_medications', 'number_outpatient', 'number_emergency', 'number_inpatient', 'diag_1', 'diag_2', 'diag_3', 'number_diagnoses', 'max_glu_serum', 'A1Cresult', 'metformin', 'repaglinide', 'nateglinide', 'chlorpropamide', 'glimepiride', 'acetohexamide', 'glipizide', 'glyburide', 'tolbutamide', 'pioglitazone', 'rosiglitazone', 'acarbose', 'miglitol', 'troglitazone', 'tolazamide', 'examide', 'citoglipton', 'insulin', 'glyburide.metformin', 'glipizide.metformin', 'glimepiride.pioglitazone', 'metformin.rosiglitazone', 'metformin.pioglitazone', 'change', 'diabetesMed', 'readmitted']


using the python skills
data base ERD 
machine learning for prediction and classification of the problem
and visualization using  matplotlib, tabluea to further analyzez andbring the data insights
